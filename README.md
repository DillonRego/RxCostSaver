Our project will extrapolate and present data on the cost of various Drugs paid through the Medicaid program. We will display data showing the change in cost for various drugs overtime, and the change in average spending for various drugs over time. We also display data that shows which drugs are produced by which manufacturer. The last feature weâ€™ll implement is the comparison of data(ex: cost of drugs) between different companies that produce the same drugs.
